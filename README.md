Postman (for API testing)

Spring Boot (via Maven for backend)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-project.git
Step 2: Setup Backend (Spring Boot)
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy
cd backend
Install dependencies using Maven:

If you’re using IntelliJ IDEA, open the project in the IDE. If you’re using the terminal, run:

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
Configure MongoDB Connection:

In the application.properties file (located in src/main/resources), set up MongoDB configurations:

properties
Copy
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/community-db
Run the Spring Boot Application:

You can run the backend using your IDE or via the command line:

bash
Copy
mvn spring-boot:run
The Spring Boot server will run on http://localhost:8080.

Step 3: Setup Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
cd frontend
Install Node.js dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required frontend packages:

bash
Copy
npm install
Configure API base URL:

In the src/config.js file, set the backend API URL:

js
Copy
export const API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/api";
Run the React Application:

Start the frontend application:

bash
Copy
npm start
The React application will run on http://localhost:3000.

Step 4: Set Up MongoDB
Download and Install MongoDB:
